# Kotlin Data Structures

This is the base repository for data structures created in the Kotlin programming language.

This repository contains examples of data structures for educational and review purposes.

# Setup

Simply clone the project using Git and open the project in IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains. I have created a simple Kotlin console app that can execute examples of each data structure in action.
