# Kotlin Data Structures

This is a repository for data structures I've created in the Kotlin programming language. The data structures included in this repository are for educational and review purposes.

# Setup

Simply clone the project using Git and open the project in IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains. I have created a simple Kotlin console app that can execute examples of each data structure in action.
